    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is used as a convention to refer to the instance of a class within its own methods. It is a reference to the current object or the object on which a method is being invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self` parameter allows you to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of the object within the class. It acts as a way to differentiate between the instance variables of the class and the parameters or variables local to a particular method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main reasons why `self` is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instance Context: Each object created from a class has its own unique set of attributes and state. The `self` parameter provides a way to access and work with the specific attributes and methods of the current instance within the class methods. It allows you to refer to the object's own data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attribute Access: By using `self`, you can access the instance attributes of an object. For example, `self.attribute_name` allows you to access and modify the value of the attribute for the particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Method Invocation: `self` is used to invoke other methods on the object. By calling `self.method_name()`, you can execute another method defined in the class on the current instance. This allows methods to interact with each other and perform complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Object Identity: `self` helps in maintaining the identity of the object within the class. It ensures that the methods and attributes refer to the correct instance of the class, even if multiple objects are created from the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `self` is used in OOP to refer to the current instance of a class. It enables accessing instance attributes, invoking methods, and maintaining the object's identity within the class. It helps in encapsulating and manipulating the object's data and behavior in a clear and consistent manner."
